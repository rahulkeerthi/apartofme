Hello! 👋🏾 My name is Rahul Keerthi and I'm a web developer, festival producer and teaching assistant at Le Wagon coding bootcamp in London. In my previous life I was a strategy manager at [Cartesian](https://cartesian.com), spending 8 years working in telecoms and technology regulation, business case development and data analytics. Since then I started the [Jumpers for Goalposts ⚽️ festival](https://jumpersforgoalpostsfestival.com) held in August 2019, attracting 1500 fans of the culture around the beautiful game, and completed Le Wagon's 🚐 intensive 9-week coding bootcamp.

Alongside supporting Le Wagon's bootcamp teaching staff, I also teach webinars (Git, JavaScript), have given talks (most recently on [building Chatbots 🤖 in Ruby](docs.google.com/presentation/d/1skw3zh0wxcjiwxqih32fbm6xdmok3m8ljozlyairwh0/edit?usp=sharing)), and I am currently working on a foodtech venture called [Cookit](https://www.trycookit.com/).

I'm a well-balanced full-stack engineer, most at home with Ruby (Rails, Jekyll) and JavaScript (ES6+, React), though my passion is in front-end development 👨🏾‍🎨 and furthering my knowledge of UX and UI. While self-motivated and capable of working on my own steam, I love working and learning with others and particularly delight in being part of mission-focused teams.

I'm comfortable working with HTML, CSS and JS, using frameworks and libraries as required, designing for both internal and external users, working with popular collaboration tools (GitHub, Trello, Slack, Notion, Google Docs), writing tests, reviewing code and pair programming, automation, as well as with CLI/CLT. I am also familiar with i18n, a11y, databases, containers and CI/CD.
