Some great news! I've been offered the opportunity to contribute to a fantastic project called Apart of Me. It's a free therapeutic service designed to guide young people through grief, giving them hope and providing them with support to navigate the complicated emotions around death and loss.

I'll be helping to maintain and evolve the website alongside helping to create a platform for the community, and hopefully doing lots more (wherever I can help basically!). I'm honoured to be able to contribute to this incredible project.
